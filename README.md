[![Actions Status](https://github.com/ponylang/http-server/workflows/vs-ponyc-latest/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ponylang/http-server/actions)

`http-server` is beta quality software that will change frequently. Expect breaking changes. That said, you should feel comfortable using it in your projects.

## Installation

* Add `http-server` (and its transitive dependencies) to your build dependencies using [corral](https://github.com/ponylang/corral):

```bash
corral add github.com/ponylang/http-server.git
```

* Execute `corral fetch` to fetch your dependencies.
* Include this package by adding `use "http/server"` to your Pony sources.
* Execute `corral run -- ponyc` to compile your application

Note: The `net-ssl` transitive dependency requires a C SSL library to be installed. Please see the [net-ssl installation instructions](https://github.com/ponylang/net-ssl#installation) for more information.

## Usage Example

TBD

## Status

This originated as the Pony HTTP/1.1 library from the standard library, formerly known as `net/http`.
It contained both an HTTP client to issue HTTP requests against HTTP servers, and
an HTTP server.

It was removed from the stdlib with [0.24.0](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases/tag/0.24.0) as a result of [RFC 55](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0055-remove-http-server-from-stdlib.md). See also [the announcement blog post](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2018/06/0.24.0-released/).
The Pony Team decided to remove it from the stdlib as is did not meet their quality standards.
Given the familiarity of most people with HTTP and thus the attention this library gets,
it was considered wiser to remove it from the stdlib and give it a new home as a separate
package, where it will not be subject to RFCs in order to rework its innarts.

Now it only contains an HTTP server, which has been rewritten and optimized for performance.
